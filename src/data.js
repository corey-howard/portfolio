    "Corey is the most hard-working developer I have had the good fortune to work with. I watched as Corey studied to become a professional developer at the same time he became a father, whilst working as a manager, during the pandemic. The consistency of his effort over the course of that year, facing such challenges, is testament to his character and intellect. A studious, reliable and talented coder, and I expect great things to come.",
