            Below are the technologies i've used and learnt over the last year during my studies. As a full stack developer, I am capable
            of working on front end, back end projects or both. I feel my strengths are best suited to working on the front end, including
            the UI and UX design of sites. Since completing my full stack course, I have since carried on learning new technologies including;
            React and Wordpress which are ongoing and I will have some commercial projects to show soon, going forward I will continue to
            broaden my stack knowledge by learning more technologies.
